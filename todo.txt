### Script Ideas

* fzf based `switch` utility that reads key to path mappings to search
  * reads key to path mappings
  * searches those paths based on the key provided at runtime
  * search query (to find?) is parameterizable
  * pipes output to fzf
  * executes command on output
    * also potentially parameterizable
* util for automatically adding symbolic links
  * searches for hidden files, which contain link spec
  * creates links
* util for finding all dirs w/ a given property and dropping a file in
  them
  * intended to add .dropbox-ignore files in git repo dirs
  * thinking about it though, this could be accomplished w/ the first
    script I describe...

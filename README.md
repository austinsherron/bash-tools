# Tools

This repo contains--or is intended to contain--production ready scripts that I regularly use in my day-to-day workflows. Lots of work is necessary before I get to that point.

## Manifest

**TODO**

## Pending Tasks

* Cleanup/deprecate scripts
* Write unit tests

## Future Work

### Script Ideas

* **Deprecated** once I discovered [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide)
~~* fzf based `switch` utility that reads key to path mappings to search~~
~~* reads key to path mappings~~
~~* searches those paths based on the key provided at runtime~~
~~* search query (to find?) is parameterizable~~
~~* pipes output to fzf~~
~~* executes command on output~~
~~  * also potentially parameterizable~~
* util for automatically adding symbolic links~~
  * searches for hidden files, which contain link spec
  * creates links
* util for finding all dirs w/ a given property and dropping a file in
  them
  * intended to add .dropbox-ignore files in git repo dirs
  * thinking about it though, this could be accomplished w/ the first
    script I describe...
